## 1. Product Vision & Strategic Context

### 1.1 Vision Statement

> **Client Advisor Experience Platform** — A relationship-first luxury selling system that transforms transactional POS operations into a **personalised luxury journey**, anchored by a **Client Digital Twin** that gives every customer a permanent digital identity shared across the entire RSMS ecosystem.

### 1.2 Why This Module Matters Most

| Module | Role in the Business |
|---|---|
| Inventory Controller | Cost Centre — tracks and protects assets |
| After-Sales Service | Retention Centre — keeps customers loyal |
| **Sales Associate** | **Revenue Centre — where money is made** |

Most retail systems treat sales associates as **POS operators**. Luxury brands treat them as **Client Advisors, Relationship Managers, Personal Shoppers, and Luxury Consultants**. This module reflects that distinction in every design decision.

### 1.3 Problem Statement

| Problem | Impact |
|---|---|
| ❌ No client memory | Associates ask the same questions at every visit |
| ❌ No relationship building | Transactions without loyalty or context |
| ❌ No personalisation | Generic product presentations to all customers |
| ❌ No luxury experience | Same checkout flow as a grocery store |
| ❌ Lost follow-ups | Anniversary and wishlist opportunities missed |
| ❌ Weak remote selling | Phone calls and WhatsApp messages with no structure |
| ❌ No unified omnichannel | BOPIS, endless aisle, and ship-from-store managed manually |
| ❌ Associates rely on intuition | No data-driven selling support |

### 1.4 Current Market Flow (Weak)

```
Customer Walks In → Associate Asks Questions → Browse Products → Purchase → Customer Leaves
```

## 3. Shared Architecture — The Digital Twin Ecosystem

> **This module introduces the Client Digital Twin — the second core entity in the RSMS platform, complementing the Product Digital Twin introduced by the Inventory module. Together, they form the Connected Luxury Asset Ecosystem.**

### 3.1 Why the Dual Passport Architecture?

Most retail platforms create three separate silos:

```
❌ CRM Module      (Customer records, no product history)
❌ Inventory Module (Product records, no customer history)
❌ Service Module   (Repair records, disconnected from both)
```

This creates a **Fancy CRM + Fancy Inventory + Fancy Service** — three disconnected systems that don't feel like a platform.

### 3.2 The Two Core Entities

```
1. Client Digital Twin    ← introduced by Sales Associate module
       ↕
2. Product Digital Twin   ← introduced by Inventory Controller module
```

Everything else in the platform is a **workflow on top of these two entities**.

### 3.3 Full Platform Architecture

### 3.5 How Modules Connect Through the Passport Ecosystem

#### At Sale (Sales Associate creates bridge between both passports)

```
Customer Purchases Rolex Submariner
          ↓
Sales Associate scans product
          ↓
Load Product Digital Twin (from Inventory module)
          ↓
Link Product to Client Digital Twin
          ↓
Append `sold` event to Product Digital Twin
Append `purchase` event to Client Digital Twin
          ↓
Register warranty → written to Product Digital Twin
          ↓
Product Digital Twin now knows its owner.
Client Digital Twin now shows owned products.
```

#### When Customer Returns for Service (After-Sales reads both passports)

```
Customer arrives at store with Rolex for repair
          ↓
Scan product serial number
          ↓
Load Product Digital Twin → full history (no re-entry)
Load Client Digital Twin → VIP tier, preferences, previous interactions
          ↓
Create AST pre-filled with:
  • Product details (from Product Digital Twin)
  • Customer details (from Client Digital Twin)
  • Warranty status (from Product Digital Twin)
  • Previous repairs (from Product Digital Twin)
          ↓
Append `repairInitiated` event to Client Digital Twin
```

#### When Associate Opens Client Profile (full 360° view)

```
Associate greets customer
          ↓
Open Client Digital Twin
          ↓
See in one screen:
  • Prefers Rolex, size M, black leather
  • Anniversary in 2 weeks
  • Wishlist: Rolex GMT Master II (available in Delhi store)
  • Last repair: 2 months ago — completed, QA passed
  • Warranty on Submariner expiring in 3 months
  • VIP tier — lifetime spend ₹48L
```

### 3.7 Shared CloudKit Container

All three modules use the same CloudKit container for real-time data sharing:

```swift
// Product Digital Twin — Shared with Inventory and After-Sales
let ProductDigitalTwinContainerID = "iCloud.com.rsms.ProductDigitalTwin"

// Client Digital Twin — New, introduced by Sales Associate, shared with all modules
let ClientDigitalTwinContainerID  = "iCloud.com.rsms.ClientDigitalTwin"
```

> **For the full Product Digital Twin specification, see: `Inventory/PRD_Inventory.md`, Section 3.**

### 6.2 User Stories

## 12. Innovation Features (SF1–SF10)

### SF1. Client Digital Twin ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Luxury brands treat customer records as databases, not relationships.

**Solution:** Every customer has a living digital identity — the **Client Digital Twin** — that accumulates every touchpoint across the entire platform.

> *Fully specified in Section 3.4 and Epic S1. This is the foundational innovation of the entire Sales Associate module.*

---

### SF2. AI Client Memory ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Associates ask returning customers the same questions at every visit.

**Solution:** When a Client Digital Twin is opened, a contextual AI Memory Card is surfaced instantly:

```

    let linkedSKU: String?
    let linkedtwinID: UUID?
}
```

---

### SF3. Opportunity Engine ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Sales opportunities are missed because associates have no proactive system.

**Solution:** Automated opportunity detection with daily digest for each advisor:

| Trigger | Opportunity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Anniversary in 14 days | Gift recommendation | Send curated cart |
| Wishlist item back in stock | Purchase opportunity | Notify client |
| Warranty expiring in 30 days | Warranty extension upsell | Send reminder |
| Repair completed | Visit opportunity | Follow-up call |
| New collection matching preference | Discovery | Share lookbook |
| Client not visited in 90 days | Retention risk | Personal outreach |

```swift
struct Opportunity: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let ClientDigitalTwinID: UUID
    let generatedAt: Date
    let type: OpportunityType
    let title: String
    let description: String
    let suggestedAction: String
    let urgency: Urgency
    let revenueEstimate: Decimal?
    let expiresAt: Date?
    var status: OpportunityStatus             // .new, .actedOn, .converted, .dismissed
    var convertedTransactionID: UUID?
}
```

---

### SF4. Luxury Circle Graph ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Gift purchases and family relationships are invisible to associates.

**Solution:** A visual relationship map showing the client's household, gift recipients, and shared purchase history — enabling intelligent gifting recommendations.

```swift
struct ClientRelationshipGraph: Codable {
    let ClientDigitalTwinID: UUID
    var relationships: [ClientRelationship]
}

struct ClientRelationship: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let relatedClientID: UUID?              // If related person is also a client
    let name: String
    let relationship: RelationshipType      // .spouse, .child, .parent, .friend, .colleague
    var giftPurchases: [UUID]               // Transaction IDs
    var sharedEvents: [UUID]                // Event IDs
    var notes: String
}
```

---

### SF5. Relationship Health Score ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Associates manage too many clients to know which relationships need attention.

**Solution:** A composite score per client relationship:

| Component | Weight | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Recency | 30% | Days since last purchase / interaction |
| Frequency | 25% | Average visits / interactions per quarter |
| Spend trend | 25% | Recent spend vs baseline |
| Engagement | 20% | Appointment attendance, cart views, outreach responses |

**Display:** Red / Amber / Green badge on client list. Red = intervention needed.

---

### SF6. Virtual Boutique Experience ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Remote selling is just a video call with product photos.

**Solution:** Before a video consultation, the client receives a curated, personal digital boutique:

```
Private Link → Personalised Digital Showroom

Your Collection — Curated for Rahul

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SF7. Concierge Checkout ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** POS is transactional. Luxury should be ceremonial.

**Solution:** After payment, a Concierge layer prompts:
- **Gift wrapping** with style selection
- **Personalised note** with brand typography preview
- **Delivery scheduling** with preferred date and address
- **Warranty registration** → auto-written to Product Digital Twin and Client Digital Twin
- **Service Passport creation** → initiates the product's digital identity link to the customer

This transforms checkout into a luxury ceremony, not a receipt printer.

---

### SF8. Contextual Selling Intelligence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** AI recommendations are generic and often wrong.

**Solution:** Recommendations are enriched with three data layers:

1. **Client Digital Twin data** — preferences, exclusions (items owned), occasions
2. **Product Digital Twin data** — provenance, authenticity, previous owners
3. **Real-time Inventory data** — live availability, in-transit ETA

Associates see WHY a product was recommended:

```
Recommended: Rolex Submariner Date
Reason: Client has purchased 2 Rolex previously,
        prefers steel/black combination,
        this model matches their wrist size (7.2"),
        in stock in current store (2 units).
```

---

### SF9. BOPIS Concierge ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** BOPIS is treated as an operational chore.

**Solution:** When a VIP client arrives for BOPIS pickup, the system detects their loyalty tier and triggers:
- Automatic VIP greeting on the associate's device
- Client Digital Twin loaded with full context
- Opportunity Engine surfacing any active follow-ups
- Option to upsell or add to the order before pickup is completed

---

### SF10. Post-Purchase Lifecycle Engine ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem:** Revenue generation stops at the payment receipt.

**Solution:** Automated, thoughtful post-purchase journey:

```
Purchase Complete → Concierge Checkout
       ↓
Thank You Message (Day 0)
       ↓
Unboxing / Care Tips (Day 2)
       ↓
Post-Purchase Feedback (Day 7)
       ↓
Warranty Registration Reminder (Day 14 if missed)
       ↓
Service Reminder (6 months)
       ↓
Anniversary / Birthday Recognition
       ↓
New Collection Matching Preference
       ↓
VIP Event Invitation (based on tier)
```

**This turns every sale into a multi-year relationship.**

### 13.2 Core Data Stack Configuration

```swift
@MainActor
class SalesAssociatePersistenceController {
    static let shared = SalesAssociatePersistenceController()

    let container: NSPersistentCloudKitContainer

    init() {
        // Client Digital Twin: new container (Sales Associate module owns this)
        container = NSPersistentCloudKitContainer(name: "RSMS_ClientDigitalTwin")

        guard let description = container.persistentStoreDescriptions.first else {
            fatalError("No persistent store descriptions found")
        }

        // New CloudKit container for Client Digital Twin
        description.cloudKitContainerOptions = NSPersistentCloudKitContainerOptions(
            containerIdentifier: "iCloud.com.rsms.ClientDigitalTwin"
        )

        description.setOption(true as NSNumber,
                            forKey: NSPersistentStoreRemoteChangeNotificationPostOptionKey)
        description.setOption(true as NSNumber,
                            forKey: NSPersistentHistoryTrackingKey)

        container.loadPersistentStores { _, error in
            if let error { fatalError("Core Data load error: \(error)") }
        }

        container.viewContext.automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent = true
        container.viewContext.mergePolicy = NSMergeByPropertyObjectTrumpMergePolicy
    }
}
```

> **CloudKit Containers in Use:**
> - `iCloud.com.rsms.ClientDigitalTwin` — Client Digital Twin (this module)
> - `iCloud.com.rsms.ProductDigitalTwin` — Product Digital Twin (shared with Inventory & After-Sales, read-only from this module except for `sold` events)

### 13.3 Offline Support Strategy

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No connectivity | Client Digital Twin reads/writes queue locally; Inventory availability shows last-cached data with warning |
| Connectivity restored | Background sync via `BGTaskScheduler` + CloudKit push |
| Conflict resolution | Server-wins for transaction status; client-wins for notes/preferences |
| Sync indicator | Subtle cloud icon in nav bar with sync status |
